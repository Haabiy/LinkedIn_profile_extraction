The idea of this project is to automate contact-info-collection process on LinkedIn making use of Python libraries( Selenium and Beautifulsoup)

***Prerequisites***
1. In the *Authentication.txt* file, make sure you put your email and password you use to log into your LinkedIn account

3. In the *Job_titles.txt* file, put some job positions that you are interested in searching
